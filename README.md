Data Cleaning & Preparation – Ensuring accuracy by handling missing values and verifying
consistency.
Data Analysis 📊 – Exploring the data through calculations, aggregations, and comparisons to
uncover patterns.
Data Visualization 📈 – Creating visual representations (charts, graphs) to illustrate trends and
insights.
Decision Making – Drawing conclusions and providing actionable recommendations based on the
analysis.
